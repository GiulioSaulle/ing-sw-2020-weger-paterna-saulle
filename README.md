## How to start JARs

You can find them under "Deliverables/JARs"

### GUI.jar
Just download it and use

java --module-path PATHTOJAVAFX --add-modules=javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.graphics -jar GUI.jar YOURIP

### CLI.jar
Download it and use

java -jar CLI.jar YOURIP
### SERVER.jar
Download it and use

java -jar SERVER.jar YOURIP

Where YOURIP is the IP of the computer which is running the Jar.
If you lunch the jars on different PCs, all IPs will be different.
You will be asked the Server IP once the jar has been launched correctly.

PATHTOJAVAFX is the path to JavaFX 12 (the lib folder!!) and changes depending on where you saved your JavaFX on your PC.

### Testing persistence and reconnection
When reconnecting, remember to vote for the same map the game was being played on before disconnection!
